# PyQt5 GameLoop for 2D Games

For a detailed walkthrough of the game loop and other components, please refer to the `Test.py` document available in this repository.

## Overview

This repository provides a basic implementation of a game loop for 2D games built with PyQt5. The game loop is a critical component of most video games that regulates the game's flow and timing. The objective of this project is to provide a flexible game loop template that can be modified to accommodate various 2D game needs.

## Getting Started

The game loop comprises of four main steps: updating the game state, rendering the new state, pausing until the next update, and repeating the loop. The updating and rendering processes are performed on a single thread following PyQt5's design architecture.

## Structure of the Game Loop

- **Initialization**: This stage sets up the necessary game objects and variables before the loop starts.
- **Updating the Game State**: The game state is updated based on the received input and the elapsed time since the last update.
- **Rendering the Game State**: The current state of the game is then drawn onto the screen.
- **Sleeping**: The application sleeps for a specified duration to control the game's speed and responsiveness.
- **Repeat**: The loop is repeated, beginning with the update of the game state.
